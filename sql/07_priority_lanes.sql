-- Saved as a VIEW instead of a one-off query, so:
--   1. The ranking logic lives in one place in the database (not duplicated in Power BI or re-typed elsewhere)
--   2. Power BI (or any other tool) can connect to it exactly like a normal table - no inline SQL needed on the BI side
--   3. It always reflects the current state of `deliveries` on refresh
